Lets users create memes by searching for images using Flickr's api and adding text.

## Installation and Usage

Just download the files and open up index.html in a web browser. An internet connection is required. Use the search bar at the top right to search for images. Select an image that you want to put text on. Add text in the large textbox and change the position of the text if desired. If you want to download the image as a .png file, click the 'Download Meme' button.
